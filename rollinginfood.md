## About this Page
Besides traveling, I also really like baking and cooking. Finding delicious recipes to try out at home is really fun. They don't always turn out as expected, but the journey is half the experience. Some of the physical labor that goes into cooking and baking can be a bit difficult for me, so it's a bit of a process trying to figure out how to best execute a recipe. So I'm always on the look out for tools that can make being in the kitchen more accessible for me. Besides cooking in the kitchen at home, I like to when we travel as well. Depending on where you stay, the kitchens may even be adapted to make it easier to use. I'll be linking videos and posts I make related to being in the kitchen on this page for anyone who's interested. I'll also be posting what I make and other food discoveries on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rollinginfood/). Many of the food featured on here will be low carb since I'm trying to work towards a healthier me.
