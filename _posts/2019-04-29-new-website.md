## Post 1

I've been away for a little while, but I'm back with a new site and a lot of plans for the rest of the year. 

 Still working out the layout for the new site, but I'll be posting soon. And I'm brushing off the cobwebs on my various social media accounts. [Twitter](twitter.com/rollwithmicole) and [Instagram](instagram.com/rollwithmicole) @rollwithmicole

If you have any ideas for places to check out I would love to hear them! I'll be on the East coast until the summer and then roadtripping out West. Details to come soon. You can reach me at rollwithmicole@gmail.com.
