title: Hello Again

Back in 2016 I started my first travel blog under the same name as this one. Unfortunately due to health reasons I had to take a step back, and then didn’t pick it back up for awhile. But with this new site I’m going to be writing about my travels again.

My former blog was a bit short lived. Partly due to unforeseen circumstances, and partly because I lost steam after putting too many expectations on myself. I was too focused on how I should do it the “right” way, instead of focusing on why I decided to put my words on the internet in the first place. 

When my family and I are going to take a trip, short or long, I always take time to plan ahead. Places we want to see, where we might want to try the food, local attractions, etc. A constant frustration was the lack of accessible information, or a hub of accessible travel information. And some of the information one did manage to find would be outdated. As the resources on the internet have grown there is more accessible information out there, but it’s still hard to really judge what it will be like unless you go experience it for yourself. And not all websites for museums, parks, restaurants, etc. show what is accessible and what’s not. Sometime’s we call ahead if it seems like it might be a place that would be inaccessible, but there’s not always someone to answer. And their view of what’s “accessible” may not be in line with your own. I for one am not comfortable driving my wheelchair up or down very steep inclines (which can also be very dangerous depending on how steep it is and other conditions). And people may forget there is a step here and there when they walk over them without having to think about it.

I want to document my travels on here so that I can have a record for myself and also anyone else who might be interested. I plan on posting about the planning phase of my travels and also what I experienced while traveling. There will be some accessibility related posts too, like any cool tools or equipment I see or hear about. This blog will house more long form posts, while my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rollwithmicole/) and [Twitter](twitter.com/rollwithmicole) accounts will have more frequent day to day experiences I have while traveling. I will also be using [Tumblr](rollwithmicole.tumblr.com) as a place to write short snippets or thoughts I have while traveling, and it will be more informal. All the places you can find me are on the [Contact Me](RollWithMicole.github.io/contact) page.

Thanks for reading.

Keep on rollin’ on!

P.s. I have another account [Rolling in Food](https://rollwithmicole.com/rollinginfood), that will have posts/videos focused on food.. There’s not much there yet but it also has its own [Instagram](instagram.com/rollinginfood) you can check out.
