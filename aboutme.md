## What This is For  
Everyone has struggles in life, whether on the surface or something deeper inside. Despite my struggles, I've been fortunate enough to still have big dreams and experience the world in a way not everyone can.

Although my body functions differently than the average person, I can still enjoy life and use my experiences to help inform and relate to people in a way I wouldn't be able to otherwise.

I want to take what I have and use it to put something good back into the world.

Traveling can be a be difficult, but it doesn't always have to be as hard as it is. I hope that with this blog I can provide some insight and tips for people looking to go to the places I travel to or even apply it to their own travels elsewhere. Whether you have a physical limitation as I do, are traveling with someone who does, trying to get around with the elderly, or even small children in strollers; I will be providing a wide range of insights into the accessibility I encounter during my travels as well as my experience as a traveler enjoying the places I go and people I meet.

If you have places you'd like me to try and explore/research, or general tips/questions for me I would love to hear them! And maybe together we can make the world a little more accessible for everyone.
