## What This is For  
Everyone has struggles in life, whether on the surface or internal. Despite my struggles, I've been fortunate enough to travel to a lot of cool places and have fun experiences. It hasn’t always gone to plan, but I’ve learned a lot from them.

I’ve had Muscular Dystrophy since birth. Although my body functions differently than the average person, I can still enjoy life and use my experiences to help inform and relate to people in a way I wouldn't be able to otherwise.

I want to take what I have and use it to put something good back into the world.

Traveling can be a be difficult, but it doesn't always have to be as hard as it is. I hope that with this blog I can provide some insight and tips for people looking to go to the places I travel to or even apply it to their own travels elsewhere. Whether you have a physical limitation as I do, are traveling with someone who does, trying to get around with the elderly, or even small children in strollers; I will be providing a wide range of insights into the accessibility I encounter during my travels as well as my experience as a traveler enjoying the places I go and people I meet.

If you have places you'd like me to try and explore/research, or general tips/questions for me I would love to hear them! Just send me an email at rollwithmicole@gmail.com. You can also reach out to me and/or follow me at any of the other links on my [Contact Me Page](https://rollwithmicole.com/contact). And maybe together we can make the world a little more accessible for everyone.
