title: Beef and Broccoli
---

Growing up a lot of my friends favorite food was Chinese takeout, but it was something I rarely enjoyed that much. I know this is because I was fortunate enough to experience authentic Chinese food in Chinatown for family dinners and my mom cooked fresh Chinese food at home. I enjoyed dishes like whole steamed fish and fresh dumplings. I didn’t like a lot of sauce either, preferring the natural flavors of the meat to come through. But two of the dishes I did enjoy from takeout were Beef and Broccoli, and Crab Rangoon. We made some keto friendly versions tonight.  

For the Beef and Broccoli:
1 lb of flank steak cut into strips
1 ½ tbsp of soy sauce
2 cloves of sliced garlic (for taste, I didn’t eat it)
½ tbsp Marsala wine (you can also use rice wine)
1/8th tsp pepper
¼ tsp five spice
333g raw broccoli (just the amount we had on hand)

Add the soy sauce, wine, garlic, pepper, five spice to the beef. Mix together.
To cook, first blanch the broccoli and set aside. 
Then saute the beef and add the broccoli after the beef has browned.
Simmer for 5 minutes (or however long it takes for the broccoli to be done to your liking).
Serve and enjoy!
Half of the entire dish came to 8 net carbs.

I also made the Crab Rangoon recipe from lowcarbingasian.com/keto-crab-rangoon. It turned out sooo GOOD. I used ¼ tsp of ground garlic, instead of the grated garlic cloves the recipe calls for. If you don’t want a strong crab flavor you may want to use less crab as well. We had to figure out what size to cut the soy paper into because the dimensions were different from the original recipe; since the asian market I went to only had larger packages of longer sheets. I tried cutting it into 3x3 and 4x4 squares. I think we will go with 4x4 next time. I’m glad I decided to buy two packets of soy paper because I’m definitely going to be making this recipe again. Just be careful when folding, as the filling might ty to come out. I will also add more cream cheese next time for a creamier filling.
